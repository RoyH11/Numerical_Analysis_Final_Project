Developed an algorithm to approximate 2-Dimensional Integral over a triangle

## How does a computer calculate integral over a triangle region? 

Sounds counterintuitive because we are so used to using calculators and forgot that it is a machine. 

It CANNOT calculate the integral... It CAN only approximate the result, hahah.
